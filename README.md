<h1>README File</h1>

In this project, I took a dataset wherein two ad campaigns were tracked. The first is our original ad, and the second is our experimental ad. 

The goal of this project is to see if the ad group can prove that it performed better than the original ad group.

I do this by running an in-depth series of investigations on this dataset to see if the experiment performed better and could pass certain statistical tests. 

The project is broken up into a few different sub-sections, which are shown with collapsible header names. The subsections are:
<ul>
  <li>Data Familiarity</li>
  <li>Data Cleaning</li>
  <li>Univariate Analysis</li>
  <li>Bivariate Analysis</li>
  <li>Statistical Testing</li>
</ul>
